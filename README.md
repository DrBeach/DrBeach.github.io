# Idle Power Generation Game

This is a simple idle game where you manage a power generation facility. The goal is to generate power, sell it for credits, and expand your operation by hiring workers and purchasing new machinery.

## How to Play

1.  **Generate Power:** Your facility generates power, which is measured in kW/h. The amount of power you generate depends on the number of workers and pedal machines you have.
2.  **Earn Credits:** The power you generate is automatically sold at a set price. Your credits will increase over time.
3.  **Hire Workers:** In the "Factory floor" section, you can hire workers to operate your machines. Each worker has an hourly cost.
4.  **Buy Pedal Machines:** You can also purchase "Pedal Machine (tm)" to increase your power generation capacity. The cost of each new machine increases.
5.  **Upgrade Machinery:** In the "Laboratory" section, you can invest credits to upgrade the efficiency of your pedal machines, allowing them to generate more power.
6.  **Manage Your Facility:** Keep an eye on your power generation, credit flow, and hourly costs to optimize your facility's growth.
